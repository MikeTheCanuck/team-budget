# Budget team project repo

This repo contains code and documents for all aspects of the Budget team project.

Per the current recommended approach for organizing code in repos, Budget team will use two repos: team-budget and team-budget-frontend.

## Team Budget repos
- team-budget: repo for all code related to backend (Django, API) and data/database
- team-budget-frontend: repo for all code related to frontend (React/HTML/CSS/JS)
